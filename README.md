# _Template Generator_

## Description

Template Generator is a command line application used to build a team of employees. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members, who can be engineers or interns. The user can input any number of team members. The application creates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.  The cards for each team member include functional links to send them email and to open the engineer's gitHub pages.

Validation of several inputs is included to assure employee information conforms to user standards.
